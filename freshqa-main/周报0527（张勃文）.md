# 实训汇报0527（张勃文）

## 0521-0527

本周我们主要的工作是调通搜索引擎模块的模型。最终的结果是将三个ipynb文件调通并且正常运行，并设计多个测试用例测试freshprompt功能，**证明了其利用RAG解决了大模型幻觉问题**。

我们主要是为了解决大模型的幻觉问题，因此我们采用了RAG技术，也就是基于搜索引擎，根据其搜索的内容进行LLM内容的实时更新。

我们基于的是**freshllm**的论文（https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03214），并对论文的部分代码进行了修改。为了便于测试，我们将输入文件和输出文件都保存在本地，并且设计测试用例进行测试。

**遇到的困难**：在调试relax和strict模块时，遇到了一些问题。如colab安装包难以安装等，最后将文件都放在本地进行，则顺利运行。

**各个文件解释：**

1. **freshprompt.ipynb**:主要是算法核心，一种基于RAG的大语言模型，可以根据最新的搜索到的信息进行回答。
2. **fresheval_strict**和**fresheval_relaxed.ipynb**都是评估的函数。
   「RELAXED」模式只衡量主要答案是否正确，「STRICT」模式则衡量回答中的所有说法是否都是最新的事实（即没有幻觉）。两者的区别主要在于prompt的不同。
3. **fresheval_strict_sample_evaluation_spreadsheet - freshqa.csv** 为用于「STRICT」模式的输入数据集；**fresheval_relaxed_sample_evaluation_spreadsheet - freshqa.csv** 为用于「RELAXED」模式的输入数据集；
4. **main.py**为爬虫腾讯网和搜狐网的信息代码，后期看下是否需要。@lfh

freshprompt的运行结果：（能够进行跑通）

test1：测试格莱美奖

test2：测试中国现在的chairman

test3：测试美国现在的总统

结论：可以作为基于RAG的LLM系统，解决大模型幻觉问题。



**下周的工作设想**

将算法都写成def函数形式，整合到后端去。以及讨论一下项目还需要做的工作：比如如何凸显出对比系统这一概念；之后再结合前端形成完整系统。
