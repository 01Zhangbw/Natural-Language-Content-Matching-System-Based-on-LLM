## FreshEval


We believe that human evaluators possess the expertise and common sense required to detect issues like hallucinations, making them more reliable than automated evaluation metrics for assessing LLMs' factuality. However, researchers have the flexibility to adjust their evaluation methods if human evaluation proves challenging. An easily implemented alternative is to use standard metrics like F1/exact match or recall, which assess the overlap between the model response and the ground truth answer(s) (e.g., see You.com's recent [blog](https://about.you.com/introducing-the-you-api-web-scale-search-for-llms) where they report `FreshQA` recall). Researchers can also use LLM-based automatic evaluation metrics such as [FactScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14251) or our `FreshEval` metric below.

### Automatic evaluation


To facilitate future evaluations, we have developed `FreshEval`, a simple automatic metric that uses few-shot in-context learning to teach an LLM to judge model responses, which achieved high agreement with human raters (see Appendix B in our paper for details).

To use `FreshEval` under a specific evaluation mode (`Relaxed` or `Strict`), please follow the instructions below:

1. Make a copy of our latest data spreadsheet and store it in your Google Drive with a new filename (e.g., `fresheval_relaxed` or `fresheval_strict`).
2. Insert 3 new columns `D`, `E`, `F` in the new spreadsheet for model responses, evaluation rating, evaluation explanation, respectively and save your model's responses in column `D` (see our sample evaluation spreadsheet below).  
3. Run the associated `FreshEval` notebook with the evaluation mode. Note that for demonstration purposes, we evaluated only the first 10 model responses. You can adjust the number as needed. 

**Note:** Currently, we recommend `gpt-4-1106-preview` over `gpt-4-0125-preview` for `FreshEval` as it yielded slightly better agreement with human annotations in our small-scale evaluation.

Here are our `FreshEval` notebooks.

After obtaining TRUE/FALSE ratings for model responses, follow the instructions below to calculate the accuracy for each question category:

1. Download our latest data spreadsheet in a Comma Separated Values (.csv) format and store it as `freshqa.csv`.
2. Open this notebook [![Using](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18LlmElJkt0joCkkpQffa1UtF9dtUdLmC?usp=sharing) and upload the `freshqa.csv` file to the session storage (`Files > Upload file to session storage`).
3. Replace the existing ratings in the notebook with your ratings and run the notebook.
